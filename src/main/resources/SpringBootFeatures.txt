Before Springboot developers are used to build application using Spring Framework.
Before Springboot we have a lot of Boilerplate code.
What is Bean in Spring Boot?
Ans: It is same as java Object , but which is managed(creation , initialization,deletion) by springFramework.
The classes under the base package of project, the springboot will scan the classes and creates the objects and we must and should
annotate @Service or @Component , @RestController, @Repository.

@Service: use this on top of class which has Business Logic.
@RestController : use this on top of class which has RestEndPoints.
@Repository : use this on top of class which on DataAccess objects.
@Component : It is generic annotation where we can replace @Service and @Repository.


@Entity: It is imported from Jakarta.
- whenever we mark this annotation on any class then springboot considers this class as a an model which we need to store in DB.
- It is mandatory annotation.
@Id: In every table we have primary key which defines unique for every product.
- It is mandatory annotation.

@Table(name = "Product_Details") : By default if we dont mention table name , then springboot create table in DB with className.
if we want explicitly define tableName then use @Table annotation.
It is optional Annotation.
@Column(name = "productName") : It is optional annotation, where we define Column name in DB.

@GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY) :
 It will auto generates the primary key.
 It Optional annotation.
